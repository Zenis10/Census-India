# Census-India
The Census of India 2011 project uses Python and pandas to handle, filter, and visualize demographic data. Information such as population, age, gender, education, and occupation is analyzed. Data is imported into a pandas DataFrame, filtered, and visualized through graphs to gain insights into the Indian population's demographics.
